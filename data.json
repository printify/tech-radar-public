It comes with a repository of curated Kubernetes applications that are maintained in the official <a href=\"https://github.com/helm/charts\">Charts repository</a>. Since we last talked about Helm, Helm 3 has been released, and the most significant change is the removal of Tiller, the server-side component of Helm 2. The benefit of a design without Tiller is that you can only make changes to the Kubernetes cluster from the client side, that is, you can only modify the cluster according to the permissions you have as a user of the Helm command. We've used Helm in a number of client projects and its dependency management, templating and hook mechanism has greatly simplified the application lifecycle management in Kubernetes.</p>"
